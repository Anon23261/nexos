# NexOS

A modern, secure microkernel-based operating system written in Rust.

## Overview

NexOS is a microkernel-based operating system that prioritizes security, modularity, and performance. Built with Rust's zero-cost abstractions and memory safety guarantees, it demonstrates advanced systems programming concepts while maintaining reliability.

### Key Features

- 🛡️ Microkernel Architecture
- 🚀 UEFI Boot Support
- 🧠 Advanced Memory Management
- ⚡ Preemptive Scheduling
- 🔒 Process Isolation
- 🔌 Modular Driver Framework
- 💻 x86_64 Architecture Support

## Building

### Prerequisites

- Rust nightly toolchain
- QEMU for testing
- x86_64-elf-gcc (cross-compiler)
- UEFI development tools

### Build Instructions

```bash
# Install dependencies
cargo install bootimage
rustup component add rust-src
rustup component add llvm-tools-preview

# Build the kernel
cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-none

# Create bootable image
cargo bootimage
```

## Running

```bash
# Run in QEMU
cargo run
```

## Design Philosophy

NexOS follows these core principles:

1. **Security First**: Microkernel architecture minimizes the trusted computing base
2. **Modern Practices**: Utilizing Rust's safety features and modern development practices
3. **Modularity**: Clean separation between kernel and user services
4. **Performance**: Zero-cost abstractions and efficient resource management
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for learning and contribution

## Current Status
